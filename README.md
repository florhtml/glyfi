  ðŸ’¬ What does Glyfi is?
</h1>

Glyfi is a fan and fast emoji chat system that uses voice recognition [to parse voice to emoji](http://www.nltk.org/book/ch05.html) language.

  ðŸ“š How does it works?
</h1>

Users use their voices to send glyfs (creative and amazing emoji messages) to communicate shorter, faster and funnier.

  ðŸ§­ Next steps?

I'll think of cool features to improve the UX!
